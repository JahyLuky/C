## About the Repository

This repository includes various C programming assignments and projects from my university studies. Each project is designed to tackle different aspects of the C programming language and computer science principles. They range from basic syntax and data structures to more complex algorithms and system-level programming.

## Projects

Here are some of the key projects included in this repository:

1. **Project 1: File Operations with Huffman or Fibonacci Coding**
   - Description: Implementation of file operations involving loading and saving data using Huffman or Fibonacci coding techniques.
   - Topics: File handling, data compression techniques, algorithm implementation.

## Project 2: Data Structures

### Description
In this project, I implemented fundamental data structures in C programming language. These structures are essential for handling and manipulating data efficiently within various applications.

### Key Concepts and Topics
- **Arrays**: Basic linear data structure used for storing elements of the same type.
- **Linked Lists**: Dynamic data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **Stacks**: Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure useful for applications like expression evaluation.
- **Queues**: First In, First Out (FIFO) structure commonly used in scheduling and breadth-first search algorithms.
- **Trees**: Non-linear data structure used for hierarchical representation and efficient searching.
  
### Projects Included
1. **Array Operations**
   - Description: Basic operations and algorithms on arrays.
   - Topics: Array traversal, searching, sorting.

2. **Linked List Implementation**
   - Description: Implementation of singly linked list and its operations.
   - Topics: Insertion, deletion, traversal.

3. **Stack Applications**
   - Description: Implementing stack operations and applications.
   - Topics: Expression evaluation, function call management.

4. **Queue Implementation**
   - Description: Implementing queue operations and applications.
   - Topics: BFS traversal, job scheduling.

5. **Binary Search Tree**
   - Description: Implementation of a binary search tree.
   - Topics: Insertion, deletion, searching.
